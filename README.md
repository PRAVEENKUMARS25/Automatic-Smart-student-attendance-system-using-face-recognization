# Automatic-Smart-student-attendance-system-using-face-recognization
The Student attendance Record System with day to day activities is a challenging task. The conventional method of calling name of each student is time consuming and there is always a chance of proxy attendance. As the time for corresponding subject arrives, the system starts taking video and then applies face detection and recognition technique to the given image and then recognizes students are marked as present and their attendance update with corresponding time and subject id. Our system is capable to identify multiple faces in real time.
